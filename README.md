## ðŸŽ¯ Course Description
This course introduces BA3 Korean Studies students to **Digital Humanities (DH)** methods, focusing on text-as-data approaches. Using **Orange Data Mining** and pre-prepared Korean corpora, students will learn how to clean, analyze, and interpret textual data.  

The DH strand complements the topical reading seminars by equipping students with methodological skills that may support their **undergraduate thesis research**.

## ðŸ“˜ Learning Objectives
By the end of the DH module, students will be able to:
- Understand the role of **Digital Humanities** in Korean Studies.  
- Apply **text preprocessing** techniques to prepare data.  
- Conduct **descriptive text analysis** (frequency, keywords, word clouds).  
- Use **classification**, **clustering**, and **topic modeling** for analysis.  
- Practice **data management and transparency** with GitHub.  
- Reflect on how computational methods may strengthen thesis projects.
