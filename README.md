## ðŸ“˜ Course Description
This is the DH strand of the BA3 course Contemporary Korea and Digital Humanities. This course is meant to introduce students to digital humanities (DH) methods, focusing on text-as-data approaches. Using Orange Data Mining and pre-prepared Korean corpora, students will learn how to clean, analyze, and interpret textual data.  

The DH strand complements the topical reading seminars by equipping students with methodological skills that may support their undergraduate thesis research. There are no programming requirements whatsoever in this course, although students will have the opportunity to explore ways to acquire such skills.

See the course [syllabus](/syllabus/syllabus.md) for complete information.
