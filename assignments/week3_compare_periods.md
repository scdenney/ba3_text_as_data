# Week 3 â€“ Comparing Across Periods

## Goals
- Compare vocabulary by time/label.

## Do in Orange
1. File (`data/nikh_corpus.csv`)
2. Preprocess Text (same settings as Week 2)
3. Bag of Words
4. Distributions / Rank (by `period` and `level`)
5. Word Cloud (per period): use `Group By` or filter

## Deliverables
- `comparison_visual.png` (two periods)
- `report.md` interpreting differences in historical framing.
