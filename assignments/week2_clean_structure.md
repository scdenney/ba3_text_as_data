# Week 2 – Cleaning & Structuring

## Goals
- Preprocess text; manage metadata for comparisons.

## Do in Orange
1. File → Preprocess Text (add `stopwords_ko.txt` and `stopwords_en.txt`; lowercase)
2. Bag of Words
3. Word Cloud
4. Data Sampler (optional: compare subsets by `date` or `section`)

## Deliverables
- `report.md` with 3–5 interesting frequent terms (and why).
- `wordcloud.png` exported from Orange.
