## Course Overview
This six-week strand introduces students to **Digital Humanities (DH)** methods for analyzing textual data, with a focus on Korean-language corpora.  
Students will learn how to prepare, analyze, and interpret text using **Orange Data Mining**.  
The aim is not technical mastery, but to understand how computational methods can support and enhance **thesis research in Korean Studies**.

### Week 6 (Nov 21): Topic Modeling & Wrap-Up
- **Lecture:** Introduction to topic modeling (LDA). Comparing clusters vs. topics. Designing a DH project.  
- **Hands-On:** Run topic modeling on a corpus, interpret top words per topic, compare with clustering.  
- **Tutorials:** *Topic Modeling widget demo*.  
- **Deliverable:** Topic model output + reflection.  

---

## Final Project (after Week 6)
- A **mini text-as-data analysis** (≈3–4 pages) applying at least two methods.  
- Include: research question, corpus, workflow (screenshots), findings, reflection on thesis relevance.
