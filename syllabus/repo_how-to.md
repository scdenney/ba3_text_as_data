# Student Guide: Setting Up Your GitHub Repo for This Course  

For this class you’ll keep all your work in a **private GitHub repository**. Don’t worry if you’ve never used GitHub before — just follow the steps below carefully.  

---

## 1. Make a GitHub Account  
- Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com).  
- Click **Sign up** (top right).  
- Pick a username (something professional).  
- Use your university email.  
- Confirm your email.  
- Done! 

---

## 2. Create Your Course Repository  
- Once logged in, click the **➕ New Repository** button (top right, by your avatar).  
- In the “Repository name” box, type:  

```
DH-TopicalReading-YourSurname
```
*(For example: `DH-TopicalReading-Kim`)*  

- Under “Visibility,” choose **Private**.  
- Check **Add a README file**.  
- Click **Create repository**.  

---

## 3. Add the Instructor as a Collaborator  
- In your new repo, click **Settings** (top right menu option).  
- On the left, click **Collaborators** (top left).  
- Click **Add people**.  
- Type:  

```
scdenney
```

- Select the name and click **Add collaborator**.  

This lets your instructor see and grade your work.

## 4. Organize Your Repo  
Your repo is like a **digital binder**. Each week, you put your homework in the right folder.  

Here’s how it should look:  

```text
DH-TopicalReading-YourSurname/
├── assignments/
│   ├── week01/
│   │   ├── week01-deliverable.md
│   │   └── screenshots/
│   ├── week02/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── week06/
│   └── final-project/
└── README.md
```

- The **assignments** folder is where all your weekly work goes.  
- Each **week** has its own folder.  
- Inside each folder:  
  - A `.md` file (your written answers)  
  - A `screenshots/` folder (your Orange screenshots)  
- The **README.md** file is like a cover page — introduce yourself and explain what this repo is for.  

---

## 5. Commit Your Work Each Week  
Every week you will:  
1. Write your reflection in the `.md` file.  
2. Save your Orange screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder.  
3. On GitHub, click **Add file → Upload files** to add them.  
4. Type a short message (like “Week 1 assignment”) and click **Commit changes**.  

---

## 6. Share the Repo Link with the Instructor  
At the start of the course:  
- Copy the web address of your repo (it will look like `https://github.com/yourname/DH-TopicalReading-YourSurname`).  
- Send that link to the instructor.  

---

## 7. Managing Your Repo  

Your GitHub repo is just a **copy of a folder structure on your computer**.  
Think of it as a backpack: one version is on your laptop, the other is online in the cloud.  
If you keep your backpack organized locally, it will stay organized online.  
You can clone a repo to any computer.

### Step 1: Choose a Good Location on Your Computer  
- Make a folder in a clear place (e.g., `Documents` or `Desktop`).  
- Name it the same as your repo:  

```
DH-TopicalReading-YourSurname
```

### Step 2: Link It to GitHub  
You have two easy ways:  

**Option A (Recommended): GitHub Desktop App**  
1. Install the app: [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)  
2. Sign in with GitHub.  
3. Open your course repo and choose **Clone to…**  
4. Pick the folder location you just created (e.g., `Documents/DH-TopicalReading-Kim`).  
5. Now your local folder and your GitHub repo are linked.  

Whenever you add or change files locally, GitHub Desktop will notice and let you **Commit + Push** them to the online repo.  

**Option B: Website Uploads**  
If you don’t want to link a local folder, you can always upload through the GitHub website. But then you’ll have to manage files both on your computer and online, which can get messy.  

### Step 3: Keep It Organized  
- Inside your local repo folder, create the `assignments/` subfolders (`week01/`, `week02/`, etc.).  
- Each week, save your `.md` file and screenshots directly into the correct folder.  
- Then use GitHub Desktop (or the website) to push your updates.  

A good rule to live by: **Organize locally first, then sync to GitHub.**  
If your computer folder is clean, your online repo will be clean too.

Just keep the core folders as needed, but otherwise do what you want.
